The Pokedex web is a vibrant and animated application. Blue and yellow are the main colours. There are three different types of fonts to describe the content. As the main section is a gallery, it can be seen like a grid. When the user hover the pictures, the number of the pokemon is displayed. There is also an option to discover more pokemon. In addition, there is a card section which displays the specific information of the pokemon. For instance, the user can check the type, ability, weaknesses, category and extra information. Finally, the user can see a black and white pokeball at the top on the right which means the availability to be caught. Once the user selects the pokeball, it changes its colour. 

The layout is the same for desktop and tablet. However, it has been adapted for mobile. The slider shows the pokemon collection. 

Part 3
The gallery is created using JavaScript. Interaction involves animation that displays information about the characters. When a character is selected, a card appears showing specific information about it. A Pokeball is created as a button to catch the character. The Pokeball changes color when the user clicks on it.
